# uber_vidz

Developed a community driven video platform where users can upload videos and follow other registered users

-Built the end to end application in two weeks using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python3, and MySQL. 

-Implemented third party APIâ€™s including Google Maps to improve geo mapping for the user. 

-Applied Flask and Jinja functionality to properly display user-submitted information, ultimately creating a network of validation checks between the registered users to keep information private and secure.

-Worked through the deployment process using AWS EC2 which included two weeks of thorough debugging and testing to verify that the application was working without errors or issues for the user.
